Let's learn some straight C programming!

There are currently two main folders: One containing a solution set to the C Programming Language and one containing Misc Exercises.
The C Programming Language Folder contains a complete set of solutions to first 6 chapters of K&R. A few notes about these exercises:
1. Each exercise is self contained. Even if breaking up a project into separate files might make sense, for the sake of each compilation, each file contains all code necessary to compile. 
2. If exercises expand on code given in the reading (most do), then that code is expanded in the exercise, and any subsequent use of that code uses only the basic version unless its obvious the exercises intend to build upon that, mainly the Polish calculator in Chapter 4 or the sorting exercise of Chapter 5.
3. All exercises are intentionally implmented using the syntax presented so far. So the programs at the beginning of the book are not as succinct until more compact syntax is presented later.
4. A highlight of these exercises are 5.20, and an expansion of 5.19, 5.19_inversion_5.20, which translates general complex declarations with function arguments to words, and vice 5.20, respectively.
